    <h2 class="heading">Lightning Tab Groups User Manual</h2>

    <p>Lightning Tab Groups is a lightweight Firefox tab group manager designed to be operated primarily from
        the keyboard. The users can quickly switch between tab groups by
        applying <a href="shortcuts.html" target="_blank">keyboard shortcuts</a> that are valid
        while the extension popup window is open. All functionality of the add-on
        is also available through the built-in <a href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell"
                                                  target="_blank">iShell</a>
        command called <span class="mono">tab-group</span>. The command allows to operate on all
        tab groups simultaneously or only on the tabs selected by the filter. Please see iShell help for
        more details.
    </p>

    <p>Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customize-firefox-controls-buttons-and-toolbars" target="_blank">Customize Toolbar...</a>
    menu allows to place the add-on action button at the beginning of the tab line as it is show in the image below:</p>

    </p>


    <p>Lightning Tab Groups works best when the "Open previous windows and tabs" option is enabled in
        the Firefox <a
                href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/restore-previous-session#w_configuring-session-restore"
                target="_blank">settings</a>.</p>

    <h3>Lightning Tab Groups Popup Window</h3>

    <p class="figure">
        <img src="images/popup_window.png">
    </p>

    <p>The extension popup window contains the list of available tab groups and provides access to
        the keyboard shortcuts used to perform tab group operations. It could be opened with the
        <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox"
           target="_blank">configurable</a> <span class="mono">Alt+G</span> key combination.
    </p>

    <p>Each row in the list displays the tab group access key, an icon of the tab group container
        (if assigned), the tab group name, and the total number of tabs/tab count in the current window.
    </p>

    <p>Tab groups are listed in the order of their creation, although there is a setting that allows
        sorting them alphabetically. It is possible to move a tab group up or down with the <span
                class="mono">Ctrl+↑/↓</span> keyboard shortcut.
    </p>

    <h3>Tab Group Mnemonics</h3>

    <p class="figure">
        <img src="images/tabgroup_mnemonics.png">
    </p>

    <p>Tab group mnemonic consists of the first letter of its name and the user-assigned color.
        The mnemonic allows to quickly determine which tab group is currently active.
    </p>

    <p>To use a pictogram as a mnemonic, insert an emoji as the first character of your tab group name
    and assign the transparent color to the group (<span class="mono">Ctrl+9</span>, explained in the next section).
    </p>

    <h3>Creating, Editing and Deleting Tab Groups</h3>

    <p class="figure">
        <img src="images/tabgroup_editing.png">
    </p>

    <p>To create a new tab group, open the extension popup window with <span class="mono">Alt+G</span>
        and press the <span class="mono">Insert</span> key. This will open the "Create tab group" form.
        In this form, you may specify the tab group name, the full name of its Firefox identity container
        (if required), and assign the mnemonic color with the <span class="mono">Ctrl+&lt;digit&gt;</span> key
        combination. Press <span class="mono">Enter</span> to save the tab group.
    </p>

    <p>To edit an existing tab group, open the extension popup window with <span class="mono">Alt+G</span>,
        select the tab group with the arrow keys, and press <span class="mono">Ctrl+Insert</span>.
    </p>

    <p>To delete a tab group, select it with the arrow keys and press <span class="mono">Delete</span>.
        This will also close all tab group tabs. The operation could be undone with the
        <span class="mono">Ctrl+z</span> key combination.
        The <span class="mono">Ctrl+Delete</span> keyboard shortcut only closes all tabs
        belonging to the selected tab group without deleting the tab group itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Switching Between Tab Groups</h3>

    <p>There are three ways to switch between tab groups: with the mouse, by selecting the necessary
        tab group with the arrow keys and pressing <span class="mono">Enter</span>, and
        directly with the access keys. For example, to switch to the Recipes tab group from the image above,
        press <span class="mono">Alt+G</span> to open the extension popup window and then press
        <span class="mono">3</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>Displaying Tab Group Tabs</h3>

    <p>To display tabs belonging to a particular tab group, select it with the arrow keys and press
        <span class="mono">→</span> (arrow right). It is possible to filter tabs by title or URL.
        Press <span class="mono">=</span> (equals sign) to enter the filtering mode.
        Pressing <span class="mono">←</span> (arrow left) will bring you back to the list of
        tab groups.
    </p>

    <h3 id="moving-tabs-between-tab-groups">Moving Tabs Between Tab Groups</h3>

    <p>To move the currently active tab or tabs selected with <span class="mono">Ctrl+&lt;click&gt;</span>
        to another tab group, press <span class="mono">Alt+G</span>
        to open the extension popup window, select the destination tab group with the arrow keys, and
    press <span class="mono">Home</span>.</p>

    <p>To move all tabs or tabs selected with <span class="mono">Ctrl+&lt;click&gt;</span> to another
        tab group, open the extension popup window,
        select the destination tab group, and press <span class="mono">End</span>.</p>

    <p>Holding <span class="mono">Ctrl</span> while pressing <span class="mono">Home</span> or
        <span class="mono">End</span> will automatically switch you to the destination tab group.</p>

    <p>To move several or all tabs to a separate browser window, select
        them with <span class="mono">Ctrl+&lt;click&gt;</span>, open the extension popup window,
        and press <span class="mono">Shift+End</span>.</p>

    <h3>Copying and Pasting Tab Groups</h3>

    <p>It is possible to copy and paste tab groups between different browser instances with the
    Lightning Tab Groups installed.</p>

    <p>To copy a tab group, open the extension popup window, select it with the arrow keys, and press
        <span class="mono">PageUp</span>. Pres <span class="mono">Shift+PageUp</span> to copy all
        existing tab groups. Pressing <span class="mono">PageDown</span> while the popup window is open
        will paste the content of the clipboard.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>To search for tabs across all existing tab groups, open the extension popup window,
        press <span class="mono">=</span> (equals sign), and type the terms you want to search.</p>

    <p>To switch to a tab from the search results list, select it with the arrow keys and press
        <span class="mono">Enter</span>, or just use <span class="mono">Ctrl+&lt;access key&gt;</span>.
